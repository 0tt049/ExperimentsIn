** Experiments in Ray Tracing
*** A port of the book [[https:raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html][Ray Tracing in One Weekend]] by [[https://github.com/petershirley][Peter Shirley]] to the Ruby programming language.

**** Introduction

As far as I know there are two ways one could programmatically generate an image. By having the program, while it is running, produce a window and in it the image. Or, by having the program produce the image and save it in a image file (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc...), which can then be opened by an image viewer. This experiment deals with the latter.

I'll be guided the book Ray Tracing in One Weekend, it describes the processes of writing a Ray Tracer using C++. I am not a C++ programmer though, and do not think that rewriting the code shown in the book as being a very effective learning methodology. Therefore I'll try to re-implement the Ray Tracer in Ruby.

**** The PPM image format

There are many image formats available, most of them are very complex, PPM is the format used throughout the book.
The code bellow (PPM image file) would produce a 3x2 pixel image of red, green, blue, yellow, white, and black colors.

#+begin_src
P3  # Set colors to ASCII

3 2 # Set file to 3 columns and 2 rows
255 # Set max color to 255

# Image content

255   0   0       0 255   0       0   0 255
255 255   0     255 255 255       0   0   0

# Image

image_width = 256
image_height = 256

hor = (0..(image_width - 1)).to_a
ver = hor.reverse

# Render
$stdout << "P3\n" << image_width << " " << image_height << "\n255\n"

ver.each do |ypx|
  hor.each do |xpx|
    r = xpx.to_f / (image_width - 1)
    g = ypx.to_f / (image_height - 1)
    b = 0.25

    ir = (r * 255.999).to_i
    ig = (g * 255.999).to_i
    ib = (b * 255.999).to_i

    $stdout << ir << " " << ig << " " << ib << "\n"
  end
end
