A port of the book [[https:raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html][Ray Tracing in One Weekend]] by [[https://github.com/petershirley][Peter Shirley]] to the Ruby programming language.

**** Introduction

As far as I know there are two ways one could programmatically generate an image. By having the program, while it is running, produce a window and, in it, the image. Or, by having the program produce the image and save it in a image file (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc...), which can then be opened by an image viewer. This experiment deals with the latter.

I'll be following the book *Ray Tracing in One Weekend*, it describes the processes of writing a Ray Tracer using C++. I am not a C++ programmer though, and do not think that simply rewriting code shown in a book as being a very effective learning methodology. Therefore I'll try to re-implement this Ray Tracer using Ruby.

**** The PPM image format

There are many image formats available, most of them are very complex, PPM will be the format used throughout this experiment. Maybe I'll change it later.

The code bellow (PPM image file) would produce a 3x2 pixel image of red, green, blue, yellow, white, and black colors. I commented a few lines in the snippet bellow to describe the PPM image format.

#+begin_src
P3  # Set colors to ASCII

3 2 # Set file to 3 columns and 2 rows
255 # Set max color to 255

# Image content

255   0   0       0 255   0       0   0 255
255 255   0     255 255 255       0   0   0
#+END_QUOTE
#+end_src

**** First gradient in Ruby

Let's begin with a simple image gradient. First we set the image size, then we store both dimensions as two arrays that will be iterated on later.

#+begin_src ruby
image_width = 256
image_height = 256
hor = (0..(image_width - 1)).to_a
ver = hor.reverse
#+end_src

~$stdout~ is our door to the outside world, and whatever gets out of this file I'll then pipe to a new file. And again, the snippet bellow sets up our image file as per PPM requirements.

#+begin_src ruby
$stdout << "P3\n" << image_width << " " << image_height << "\n255\n"
#+end_src

And now for the fun part. Think of this as we were creating a 2D array of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple][3-tuple]]. Line by line, and pixel by pixel. Each pixel is described by 3 integers, each of those is a RGB value. Notice that we first get a floating number between 0.0 and 1.0, that has to be normalized back to an integer between 0 and 255. And lastly ~$stdout~ spits out our 3 values, go down a line, and iterate again.

#+begin_src ruby
ver.each do |ypx|
  hor.each do |xpx|
    r = xpx.to_f / (image_width - 1)
    g = ypx.to_f / (image_height - 1)
    b = 0.25

    ir = (r * 255.999).to_i
    ig = (g * 255.999).to_i
    ib = (b * 255.999).to_i

    $stdout << ir << " " << ig << " " << ib << "\n"
  end
end
#+end_src

The creating-image-file part gets dealt by the command line. At least for now.

#+begin_src shell
$ ruby raytracer.rb > gradient.ppm
#+end_src

And since most places don't know what to do with an PPM image file, we can must also convert it to whatever file format you prefer. I'm converting it to JPEG using ImageMagick.

#+begin_src shell
$ convert gradient.ppm gradient.jpg
#+end_src
[[./Raytracing/gradient.jpg]]

**** A bit of refactoring

This section of the book shows the creation of a ~vec3~ class that could represent a coordinate or a RGB value. I'm sticking with Ruby's ~Vector~ class for now. I'm using this class to implement a ~write_color~ helper function.

#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./Raytracing/color.rb
require 'matrix'
def write_color(pixel_color, out = $stdout)
  raise TypeError unless pixel_color.is_a? Vector

  out << (pixel_color[0] * 255.999).to_i << " " <<
    (pixel_color[1] * 255.999).to_i << " " <<
    (pixel_color[2] * 255.999).to_i << "\n"
end
#+end_src

And now we can use ~write_color~ inside our Ray Tracer.

#+begin_src ruby :tangle ./Raytracing/raytracer_02.rb :
require_relative 'color'

image_width = 256
image_height = 256
hor = (0..(image_width - 1)).to_a
ver = hor.reverse

$stdout << "P3\n" << image_width << " " << image_height << "\n255\n"

ver.each do |ypx|
  hor.each do |xpx|
    color_arr = [
      (xpx.to_f / (image_width - 1)),
      (ypx.to_f / (image_height - 1)),
      0.25
    ]
    pixel_color = Vector.elements(color_arr)
    write_color(pixel_color)
  end
end
#+end_src
